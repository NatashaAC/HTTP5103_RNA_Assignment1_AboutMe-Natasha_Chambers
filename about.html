                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi my name is Natasha Chambers; my pronouns are she/her. A little bit about me, 
                    I love drinking matcha tea, lattes from Starbucks and nature. 
                    If I could have a room full of plants that would be amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time I enjoy watching anime and cartoons through streaming platforms like Netflix, or Disney+. 
                    From time to time I like to watch movies. My favourite genres are comedy, action, adventure and romantic comedies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also love to play videos games, it’s one of the reasons why I actually got into coding/programming. 
                    The system that I use the most would have to be my Nintendo Switch and my favourite game would be Zelda BOTW. 
                    A little fun fact, I have most of the Nintendo systems.

            <h2>Website Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I recently graduated from Humber College’s Web Design and Interactive Media program 
                with an Advance Diploma and I have a background in Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve always had a fascination with technology and constantly wondered how devices worked. 
                In high school I took auto shop and construction classes. I had fun rebuilding mowers, engines, and fixing tires. 
                Overall, I just enjoyed working with my hands more than doing research or writing. 
                The Electronics Engineering Technician program at Humber was a way to get the best of both worlds, but then my interests changed. 
                I started to wonder how programs, websites, apps and games worked. 
                I wanted to learn how to create my own websites, apps, and games, which lead me to enter the Web Design and Interactive Media program. 
            </p>
